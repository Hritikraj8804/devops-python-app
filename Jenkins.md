# CI/CD Pipeline for a Python Flask Application with Jenkins üöÄ

This repository documents my hands-on experience setting up a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Python Flask application using Jenkins. The goal was to automate the entire process from code checkout to deployment.

This project was completed as part of a hands-on challenge. It demonstrates the fundamental stages of a modern software delivery pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages ‚úÖ

The Jenkins pipeline was configured to execute the following stages automatically upon a code change:

1.  **Clone Repository**: Fetches the latest source code from the Git repository.
2.  **Build**
3.  **Setup Environment**: Creates a clean Python virtual environment and installs all the necessary application dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using `pip`.
4.  **Build Docker Image**: Containerizes the application by building a Docker image based on the provided `Dockerfile`. This ensures a consistent environment for the application to run in.
5.  **Push to Docker Hub**: Tags the newly built Docker image and pushes it to a container registry (Docker Hub) for storage and distribution.
6.  **Deploy Application**: Pulls the image from Docker Hub and runs the container, deploying the Flask application locally and exposing it on port `5000`.

## Key Learnings & Challenges Faced üí°

This challenge provided valuable real-world insights into the nuances of CI/CD automation. The main challenges I encountered and the lessons learned are highlighted below.

### 1. Secure Credential Management
A major hurdle was securely providing the Docker Hub credentials to the pipeline. Hardcoding credentials directly in the `Jenkinsfile` is a significant security risk.

* **Learning**: The correct approach is to use the **Jenkins Credentials Manager**. I learned to store my Docker username and password as a secret text or username/password credential in Jenkins and then access it securely within the pipeline script. This prevents sensitive information from being exposed in logs or source code.

### 2. Environment and Tool Configuration
The pipeline initially failed because essential tools were not correctly configured on the Jenkins agent.

* **Learning**: A CI/CD pipeline is only as reliable as its underlying environment. I learned to ensure that all necessary tools (like **Git**) are properly installed and configured in the system's PATH on the Jenkins agent where the pipeline executes.

### 3. Cross-Platform Scripting (Windows vs. Linux)
As a Windows user, I couldn't directly use the shell (`sh`) commands common in most online tutorials. This required adapting the pipeline scripts for the Windows environment.

* **Learning**: Jenkins is platform-aware. For commands to run on a Windows agent, you must use the `bat` step instead of `sh`.
    * **Example**: `sh 'echo Hello'` becomes `bat 'echo Hello'`
* This also extends to environment variable syntax. Linux/macOS uses `$VARIABLE` or `${VARIABLE}`, while Windows uses `%VARIABLE%`. I learned to be mindful of the target OS and use the correct syntax for scripts to run successfully.
